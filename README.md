The ipynb contains the impelemntation for preprocessing and processing images from a medical dataset which can be found here:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri/data

I have used a pretrained model ResNet18 and defined multiple sets of transformations and different optimizers such as different loss functions to see how the model performs.
The dataset itself contains MRI, X-rays of different brain tumors.
