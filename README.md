# ML-on-Medical-Dataset

This Jupyter notebook contains the implementation for preprocessing and processing medical images from a dataset, available at the following link:

The model utilized is a pretrained ResNet18, with various transformations applied and multiple optimizers and loss functions experimented with to assess model performance. The dataset includes MRI scans and X-rays of different types of brain tumors.

The accompanying report outlines the experiments conducted to improve the model's performance. As a result, I was able to enhance the model's accuracy by 10%, from 65% to 75%.
